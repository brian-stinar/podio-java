Why I Forked
---------------------

Podio crossed the integer threshold around June 30, 2022. They don't support their Java library, and my client couldn't upgrade to this one (you should try this first): https://github.com/OvalUK/podio-java, since this guy maintained a BUNCH of stuff. However, he upgraded tons of other dependencies, so this might not work for you. If you ONLY need/want the integer-to-long conversion, try this library, since the Podio Provided one will not work, and they will be unable/unwilling to provide you with support.


Podio Java API Client
---------------------

This is the Java client for the [Podio](http://podio.com) API. Detailed documentation for the API is available on https://developers.podio.com. There you will find details on how to create an API key and use the API.

An introduction to the Java client is also available at https://developers.podio.com/clients/java
